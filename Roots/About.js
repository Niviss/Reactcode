        <p>React Router is a JavaScript framework
           that lets us handle client and server
           -side routing in React applications.
            It enables the creation of single-
            page web or mobile apps that allow 
            navigating without refreshing the 
            page. It also allows us to use browser
             history features while preserving the
              right application view</p>
